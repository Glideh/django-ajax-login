Aim
===

Display a modal allowing to login or register for an account with ajax.
The modal would popup if an ajax action requiring authentication returns forbidden.
This is far to work out of the box, you are invited to discover the code.
Any help to improve & package the code is much appreciated.

Installation &amp; Requirements
===============================

Copy the files in the good locations & DR/IY.
This is designed to work with `Django 1.6`, `python-social-auth`, `django-registration`, `Bootstrap` &amp; `django-crispy-forms`
But it is more here to give an idea of how we could achieve an ajax login/registration
